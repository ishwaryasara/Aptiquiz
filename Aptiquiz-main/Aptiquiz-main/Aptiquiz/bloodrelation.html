                 <p>1. Apply the question to yourself <br>
                    2. Break the question into very small parts.When the statement is very long, it can get confusing. So break down every statement in the question into sub statements and solve the question. <br>
                    3. Do not assume the gender.Do not assume the gender of any person in the question just based on the names given in the question. <br>
                    4. Draw clear diagrams as you solve .An easy trick to solve such questions with 100% accuracy is to draw a family try where people of the same generation are placed at the same level and the entire diagram is in the form of a hierarchy.
