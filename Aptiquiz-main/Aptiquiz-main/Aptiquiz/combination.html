                        In probability, it is often necessary to figure out how many possible outcomes there are for an event or situation. For example, say that someone is trying to find the probability of picking a single book out of a stack of 5 books. In this case, figuring out the number of ways this can be done is fairly straightforward. But what if they instead want to find out the probability of picking out 4 specific books from a stack of 15 books? In this case, trying to list out all of the possibilities would be difficult and time-consuming. So, finding a different way to find out how many possibilities there are to pick out four books from a stack of 15 other than just listing out all of the ways this can be done would be helpful. <br>
                        First, figure out what n and r are equal to. Then, input n and r into the combination formula. Lastly, simplify the formula. If possible, input the values into a calculator. If this is not possible, try to cancel values in the numerator and the denominator. <br>
