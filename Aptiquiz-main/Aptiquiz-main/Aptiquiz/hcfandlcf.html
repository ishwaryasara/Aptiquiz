                    <p>HCF: <br>
                        Step 1: Take the smaller number as the divisor and the larger number as a dividend. <br>
                        Step 2: Perform division. If you get the remainder as 0, then the divisor is the HCF of the given numbers. <br>
                        Step 3: If you get a remainder other than 0 then take the remainder as the new divisor and the previous divisor as the new dividend. <br>
                        Step 4: Perform steps 2 and step 3 until you get the remainder as 0.   <br>    
                       LCF: <br>
                       Step 1: Check whether the given numbers are divisible by 2 or not. <br>
                       Step 2: If the number is divisible by 2 then divide and again check for the same. If the numbers are not divisible by 2 then check 3, and so on.
                       Step 3: Perform step 2 until you get 1 in the end.     </p>
