                    <p>Probability means the possibility or chances of an event occurring or happening. <br>
                        For example, when a coin is tossed, then we will get ahead or tail. It is a state of probability. <br>
                        
                        In an event, the happening probability is equal to the ratio of favourable outcomes to the total number of possible outcomes.
                        It represents as,<br>
                        1.Probability is a measure of how likely an event is to occur. <br>
                         2.Probability is expressed in the form of fractions. <br>
3.Favorable number of outcomes <br>
4.Total number of outcomes <br>
5.Probability ranges between 0 and 1. <br>
