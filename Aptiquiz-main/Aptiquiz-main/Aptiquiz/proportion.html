                        Proportion is indicated as ‘::’ or ‘=’. If the ratio x:y is equal to the ratio of a:b, then x,y, a,b are in proportion.
We mention it using the symbols is as x:y=a:b or x:y:: a:b <br>
Proportion is an equation that specifies that the two given ratios are identical to one another. We can say that the proportion states the equivalency of the two fractions or the ratios i.e Equivalent Ratios. Proportions are represented by the symbol (::)
 or equal to (=) <br>


That is the proportion is signified by double colons. For example, ratio 6:8 <br>
 is the same as ratio 3:4 <br>
This can be written as 6:8::3:4 <br>
Product of means = Product of extremes <br>

Thus, a:b∷c:d⇔(b×c)=(a×d)
