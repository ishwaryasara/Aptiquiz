                        1.Time Taken: Rate of work and time are inversely proportional to each other. Thus, R = 1/T <br>
2.Work Done: It takes (T) time to complete a certain amount of work (W). The number of units of work done per unit time. <br>Thus, Work Done (W) = Time (T) * Rate of Work (R) <br>
3.Negative Work: Assume that there are two people A and B who have been assigned to build a table.Now, work done by C is termed as negative work as C is effectively lowering the amount of work done by A and B. <br>
4.Work Equivalence: Please note that the work one by people/pipes can be stated mathematically as,<br>
5.Work done = rate of work x time
